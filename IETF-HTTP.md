# IETF - HTTP Working Group

*The following text will be included as a change request to the [Internet
Engineering Task Forceâ€™s Cookies: HTTP State Management Mechanism](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis/)
document. The precise chapters to include this text are to be determined.*

## Legal Basis Attribute

A new attribute titled `lbu` or `legal-basis-uri` will be added to the
allowed attributes of the `Set-Cookie` syntax.

The purpose of the `lbu` label is to provide an immutable document that
contains the legal basis used to collect, store, use, and restrict the
associated `cookie-value` such that storage retrieval operations can utilize
modifications to Content Security Policy to determine if a storage read
operation should be allowed or denied.

The value provided as the `lbu` attribute must conform to the URI schema.
(RFC 3986 which defined URI is already an informative reference). Any value that
does not conform to URI will be rejected and the operation will proceed as if
the `lbu` attribute had not been provided.

`Set-Cookie` operations will store the `lbu` value with the cookie-name and
cookie-value.

The following is an example of Set-Cookie operation that includes an LBU
value.

```text
Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; LBU=https://ex.io/eu-ads-v1.html
```

LBU documents must be immutable and never change once published. They SHOULD
contain a version component in their construction.

If the implementor detects a change to the content of the LBU document which
does not relate to user preferences such as language, then the implementor
SHOULD consider the LBU value to be unusable and reject it. This behavior
encourages authors of LBU documents to exercise strict version controls.
