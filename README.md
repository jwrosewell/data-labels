# Data Labels

A decentralized method of attaching the terms underwhich data or copyright
protected content is provided by a sender to a recipient such that the recipient
can either accept or reject those terms unambiguously or an intermediary can
facilitate data transfers based on knowledge of terms acceptable to both sender
and recipient.

## Content

This repository contains a practical implementation of a single data label
concept consistently across many diverse technical standards to improve data
protections, protect content subject to copyright, and competition in digital
markets.
