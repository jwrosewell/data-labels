# Appendix 1 – Countries where GDPR or ‘essentially equivalent’ legislation has been implemented

Under the GDPR, the EU can recognize that other countries or territories are
‘adequate’, meaning that they provide an ‘**essentially equivalent**’ level of
data protection to that which exists within the EU under the GDPR.[^1]

[^1]: <https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-the-eu/data-protection-and-the-eu-in-detail/adequacy/>

The EU’s recognition of adequacy[^2] means that the data protection laws in
place in the third country are similar in principle and in practice to those of
the EU. It is therefore a useful proxy for assessing which countries have
legislation similar to the GDPR.

The table below lists all countries that have implemented the GDPR, as well as
some of those which have an EU adequacy decision in place.[^3]
