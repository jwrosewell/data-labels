## License Grants and Conditions

The Content Owner grants only You the right under only these Terms to use the
Content to Train or fine-tune Foundation models.

Foundation models are large models that are produced using deep learning or
other machine learning techniques. Foundation models are trained on very large
numbers of assets so that they can be applied to a wide range of use cases.
Foundation models typically possess generative capabilities in one or more
media.

Fine-tuning can specialize a general-purpose foundation model for a narrower set
of use cases.
