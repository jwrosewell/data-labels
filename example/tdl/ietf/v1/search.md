## Definitions

1.1 “Content Owner” - means each individual or legal entity that holds legal
right to the Content.

1.2 “Content” - means any data to which the Licensor has attached these Terms.

1.3 “Terms” - means this document.

1.4 “License” – means the rights granted to you.

1.5 “You” (or “Your”) - means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights

## License Grants and Conditions

The Content Owner grants only You the right under only these Terms to use the
Content in a search application that directs users to the location from which
the Content was retrieved.

The presentation of any Content that is included in search output includes the
following conditions:

-   A reference to the location that the Content was obtained is presented as
    part of the output.
-   The Content can only be represented in the output with excerpts that are
    drawn verbatim from it.

The Content can be used in ranking, but not present in output.

Internal processing of Content to perform ranking and presentation can include
the use and training of AI models. This only includes any training that is
necessary to produce models used in the search application.

With both these conditions, a preference to allow Search usage enables the
presentation of links and titles in what is considered "traditional" search
results.
